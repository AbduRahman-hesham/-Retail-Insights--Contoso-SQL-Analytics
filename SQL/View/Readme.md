## 📊 Executive Monthly Sales View

**Objective**: Create a **SQL view** that delivers a high-level snapshot of monthly business performance.

**Metrics Included**:
- ✅ **Total Sales** per Month
- 🆕 **New Customers** (first-time buyers)
- 🔁 **Repeat Customers** (customers with prior purchases)
- 🏆 **Top Product Category** by Monthly Revenue

### 📌 Skills Demonstrated
- Complex joins across fact and dimension tables  
- Aggregation using `GROUP BY` and conditional logic  
- Subqueries to identify first-time and returning customers  
- `RANK()` or `MAX()` to identify the top-selling category  
- Use of **SQL Views** for reusable analysis  

### 🧠 Business Use Case
This view is built for executive-level dashboards where stakeholders need a **360° view** of commercial performance each month. It answers:

- Are we growing revenue month over month?
- How many **new customers** are we attracting vs **retaining**?
- Which **product categories** are driving sales?

### 🧬 Strategic Impact
- Helps leadership detect business momentum, customer acquisition trends, and category performance.
- Supports decision-making for **budgeting**, **marketing**, and **product strategy**.
- Can be used as a base layer for **Power BI/Tableau dashboards** or embedded into operational reports.
